# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical token storage vulnerability identified in the security assessment. The current implementation stores authentication tokens in localStorage, making them accessible to malicious scripts and vulnerable to XSS attacks. This feature will implement secure token storage using httpOnly cookies and proper session management to protect user authentication tokens from theft and unauthorized access.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The Google OAuth-based authentication mechanism in the fullstack application
- **Token_Storage_Service**: The component responsible for securely storing and retrieving authentication tokens
- **Session_Manager**: The backend service that manages user sessions and token validation
- **Frontend_Client**: The React-based user interface that handles user authentication flows
- **Backend_API**: The FastAPI-based server that processes authentication requests

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my authentication tokens to be stored securely, so that malicious scripts cannot access them and compromise my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates, THE Token_Storage_Service SHALL store the authentication token in an httpOnly cookie
2. THE Token_Storage_Service SHALL set the Secure flag on authentication cookies to ensure transmission only over HTTPS
3. THE Token_Storage_Service SHALL set the SameSite attribute to "Strict" to prevent CSRF attacks
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL remove any existing localStorage token storage mechanisms
5. THE Frontend_Client SHALL not have direct access to authentication tokens stored in cookies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to automatically handle token refresh and expiration, so that users have a seamless experience without security compromises.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication token expires, THE Session_Manager SHALL automatically attempt to refresh the token
2. IF token refresh fails, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect the user to the login flow
3. THE Session_Manager SHALL validate token expiration on every authenticated request
4. THE Backend_API SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes for expired or invalid tokens
5. THE Frontend_Client SHALL handle authentication state changes without accessing tokens directly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper session management controls, so that I can ensure secure user sessions and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Session_Manager SHALL implement configurable session timeout periods
2. WHEN a user logs out, THE Authentication_System SHALL invalidate the session and clear all authentication cookies
3. THE Session_Manager SHALL maintain a server-side session store for token validation
4. THE Backend_API SHALL implement session cleanup for expired sessions
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide endpoints for session management operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want the token storage implementation to follow security best practices, so that the application meets enterprise security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Token_Storage_Service SHALL implement proper cookie security attributes (httpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL not expose sensitive token information in client-side code or logs
3. THE Session_Manager SHALL implement proper error handling without leaking token information
4. THE Backend_API SHALL validate all authentication requests server-side regardless of client state
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide audit logging for authentication events without exposing sensitive data
