# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create core secure logging infrastructure

  - Implement SecureLoggerManager class with environment detection and redaction capabilities
  - Create SensitiveDataFilter for automatic redaction of credentials and tokens
  - Add comprehensive redaction patterns for database URLs, passwords, tokens, and secrets
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Implement environment configuration management

  - Create AppConfig class for centralized environment detection and configuration
  - Add methods for safe database information display and production config validation
  - Implement environment-specific logging configuration settings
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Update database connection with secure logging

  - Replace direct DATABASE_URL printing with secure logging in database.py
  - Implement environment-aware SQLAlchemy echo configuration (only in development)
  - Add safe database connection status logging for production
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 2.3, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Configure application startup with secure logging

  - Update main.py to initialize SecureLoggerManager at startup
  - Add production configuration validation during startup
  - Implement secure logging for application lifecycle events
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Integrate secure logging with existing authentication system

  - Update auth.py to use secure logging manager instead of direct Python logging
  - Replace `logging.getLogger(__name__)` with `get_secure_logger(__name__)`
  - Ensure no sensitive token information is logged in production through automatic redaction
  - Maintain existing security logging functionality with enhanced redaction capabilities
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.2, 4.5_

- [x] 6. Update session management with secure logging

  - Replace `logging.getLogger(__name__)` with `get_secure_logger(__name__)` in session.py
  - Ensure session-related logging uses secure redaction patterns
  - Verify no session IDs or sensitive session data are exposed in production logs
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.2, 4.5_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive testing for secure logging
  - Write unit tests for SecureLoggerManager redaction patterns and environment detection
  - Create unit tests for AppConfig environment-specific configuration and validation methods
  - Write unit tests for SensitiveDataFilter and SecureFormatter classes
  - Implement security tests to verify no credentials are exposed in production logs across all components
  - Add tests for edge cases in redaction patterns (malformed URLs, special characters)
  - Add tests for production configuration validation and error handling
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_
