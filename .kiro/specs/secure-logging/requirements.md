# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the information disclosure vulnerability identified in the security assessment where database credentials and other sensitive information are being logged to console in production environments. The current implementation exposes database URLs with embedded credentials in production logs, creating a significant security risk. This feature will implement secure logging practices that prevent sensitive information exposure while maintaining necessary debugging capabilities for development.

## Glossary

- **Logging_System**: The application's logging mechanism that outputs diagnostic and operational information
- **Database_Connection_Manager**: The component responsible for establishing and managing database connections
- **Environment_Configuration**: The system that manages environment-specific settings and configurations
- **Production_Environment**: The live deployment environment where the application serves real users
- **Development_Environment**: The local or staging environment used for development and testing
- **Sensitive_Information**: Any data that could compromise security if exposed, including credentials, tokens, and connection strings

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want sensitive database credentials to be protected from exposure in production logs, so that unauthorized users cannot access the database connection information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Logging_System SHALL not output database URLs containing credentials in production environments
2. WHEN the application starts in production mode, THE Database_Connection_Manager SHALL not log complete connection strings
3. THE Logging_System SHALL implement environment-aware logging that distinguishes between development and production
4. THE Environment_Configuration SHALL provide secure logging configuration options
5. THE Database_Connection_Manager SHALL log only non-sensitive connection information in production

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain debugging capabilities in development environments, so that I can troubleshoot database connection issues without compromising production security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode, THE Logging_System SHALL provide detailed connection information for debugging
2. THE Database_Connection_Manager SHALL log masked or truncated connection strings that preserve debugging utility
3. THE Logging_System SHALL implement different log levels for development and production environments
4. THE Environment_Configuration SHALL allow developers to enable verbose logging in non-production environments
5. THE Logging_System SHALL provide clear indicators of which environment mode is active

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want structured logging with appropriate security controls, so that I can monitor application health without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Logging_System SHALL implement structured logging with consistent format and security filtering
2. THE Logging_System SHALL automatically redact or mask sensitive information in all log outputs
3. WHEN logging configuration changes, THE Logging_System SHALL validate security settings before applying
4. THE Logging_System SHALL provide audit trails for configuration changes without exposing sensitive data
5. THE Environment_Configuration SHALL enforce secure logging defaults for production deployments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want the logging system to follow security best practices, so that the application meets enterprise security standards for information handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Logging_System SHALL implement a whitelist approach for information that can be logged in production
2. THE Logging_System SHALL provide configurable redaction patterns for different types of sensitive information
3. THE Database_Connection_Manager SHALL validate that no credentials are exposed in any log output
4. THE Logging_System SHALL implement log sanitization that removes or masks sensitive patterns
5. THE Environment_Configuration SHALL provide security validation for all logging configurations
